        <p>Intruder, observer, freerider. Lost, alone, online. Wander, wonder, winded. Connection cannot be spelled without con, friendship without end, collaboration without labor, together without get. I wish I could be other, perhaps that is why I yearn for the other. New beats against the tight surface of the defense, seeping out a little at a time, melted by the tension of the iridescent surface, most of it flown there with a Rorschach stain of formalized ignorance; there is the wall of the second house, squinting in and out to see, and the question of how something penetrates from the house of theory to the house of practice remains shrouded in the house of unformed sensations and paths of chaotic patterns, while the third house has no time or distance with you. As my feet walk from the ashes of Katarr, I shall not fear, for in fear, lies death. I go to work, shop for groceries, visit playgrounds, sleep, dream… And while I do all this, I wonder—what are people doing on the other side of the planet, in a different corner of the world? So many people, all doing such different things at the same time. And while we talk about connection, presence and togetherness, some people feel completely helpless. Helplessness strung tight, sewn-up seated on a swivel-chair in the shadow cast by the third house, a house that can't be seen from this angle, because it lies beyond a high wall.</p>
